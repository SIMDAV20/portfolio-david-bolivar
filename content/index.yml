    - title: Cloud & DevOps
      questions:
        - label: What cloud platforms and DevOps tools do you use?
          content: |
            I specialize in AWS and Azure cloud architectures. On AWS I work daily with EC2, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudFront, Cognito, CloudFormation, and SSM. On Azure I use Azure Pipelines and Key Vault. For containerization and CI/CD I rely on Docker and GitHub Actions.
        - label: Do you have experience with Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?
          content: |
            Yes. I design and deploy cloud infrastructure using AWS CloudFormation and coordinate CI/CD pipelines on both AWS and Azure. I've built serverless event-driven architectures from scratch and applied IaC principles to ensure repeatable, scalable deployments.
    - title: Backend & Frontend
      questions:
        - label: What backend technologies do you master?
          content: |
            My core backend stack includes Node.js, NestJS, FastAPI, Flask, and Laravel (PHP). I've built REST APIs, serverless microservices, and event-driven systems for banking, ERP, and academic platforms.
        - label: What frontend frameworks do you use?
          content: |
            I build interfaces with Nuxt.js, Vue 2 & 3, React, Next.js, and Angular. I also have experience with React Native and Flutter for cross-platform mobile development. For styling I use Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap.
        - label: What databases do you work with?
          content: |
            I work with both relational and NoSQL databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB. I have experience optimizing complex queries, stored procedures, and database migrations for high-availability systems.
    - title: Education
      questions:
        - label: What is your academic background?

            I hold a Master's degree in IT Project Management from Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (Spain, 2023–2024), a Systems Engineering degree from Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola (Peru, 2013–2022), and an International Business degree from San Ignacio University (USA, 2013–2022). I'm also currently completing a Bootcamp at TripleTen (2025–present) focused on Data Analysis and AI.
        - label: Are you currently learning anything new?
          content: |
            Yes! I'm actively expanding into Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis. I'm training with Python, pandas, and machine learning fundamentals to complement my cloud and backend expertise with strategic data-driven decision-making skills.
        - label: What languages do you speak?
